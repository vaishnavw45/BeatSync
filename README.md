## Features

- **Millisecond-accurate synchronization**: Abstracts [NTP-inspired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) time synchronization primitives to achieve a high degree of accuracy
- **Cross-platform**: Works on any device with a modern browser (Chrome recommended for best performance)
- **Spatial audio:** Allows controlling device volumes through a virtual listening source for interesting sonic effects
- **Polished interface**: Smooth loading states, status indicators, and all UI elements come built-in
- **Self-hostable**: Run your own instance with a few commands


> [!NOTE]
> Beatsync is in early development. Mobile support is working, but experimental. Please consider creating an issue or contributing with a PR if you run into problems!

## Quickstart

This project uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo).

Fill in the `.env` file in `apps/client` with the following:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws
```

Run the following commands to start the server and client:

```sh
bun install          # installs once for all workspaces
bun dev              # starts both client (:3000) and server (:8080)
```
